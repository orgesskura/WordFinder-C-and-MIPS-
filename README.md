Puzzle solver(word finder based on words from a dictionary) in C and MIPS (Both 1D and 2D)
By using provided code in C by University Of Edinburgh for solving  a puzzle solver in 1D, I implement a puzzle solver in 1D and 2D as well in C and in MIPS. Also, in the last take I extend the code to support wraparound in a 2D puzzle.
